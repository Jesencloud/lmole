## Project: lmole (Linux Mole) - Extreme UX & Interaction Refinement

Today's session focused on advanced TUI interaction, responsive design, and perfecting the navigation flow for heavy users.

### 1. Interaction & Workflow
*   **Integrated Numeric Checkboxes**: Re-engineered the "Analyze Disk" selection UI to merge indices into the selection brackets (e.g., `[1]`, `[12]`). Numbers are dynamically replaced with a green `[✓]` upon selection, mirroring the elite `Uninstall` module.
*   **Multi-Digit Selection**: Implemented an intelligent digit buffering system. Users can now select any item (1-50) by quickly typing its index (e.g., press `1` then `4` to select item 14), enabling lightning-fast navigation for power users.
*   **Zero-Latency Navigation**: Optimized the directory traversal engine with a **State Snapshot Stack**. Returning to parent directories is now instantaneous and completely bypasses the Rust engine scan, as previous results are cached in memory.
*   **Selection Summary**: Added a persistent **"☉ Selected Items to Remove"** summary at the bottom of the analysis views (Main and Top Files), providing clear visibility of the removal queue in the signature Mole purple style.
*   **Auto-Back Logic**: Enhanced the cleaning workflow to automatically return to the parent directory when the current folder becomes empty after deletion, reducing manual keypresses.

### 2. Layout & Accessibility
*   **Responsive TUI Design**: Implemented a fully adaptive layout for the "Analyze Disk" module. The UI dynamically detects terminal width, automatically shrinking or hiding progress bars and truncating filenames to prevent line wrapping on small screens.
*   **Navigation Stability**: Performed a deep-level stabilization of the arrow key capture logic. Refined the raw-mode input buffer to ensure 100% reliable 3-byte escape sequence capture across GNOME Terminal, xterm, and SSH sessions.
*   **Back Navigation Overhaul**: Added support for **B** and **H** (Vim-style) keys for returning to previous folders, alongside a clearer `← Back` UI hint.
*   **Search Revert**: Decoupled the experimental real-time search from the `Uninstall` module to restore rock-solid stability to the core navigation system while keeping the visual and alignment improvements.

## Project: lmole (Linux Mole) & Mole - Visual Identity & Smart Insights

This session established the modern visual identity and ported key intelligence features from macOS to the Linux ecosystem.

### 1. Visual Modernization
*   **Gemini-Style Progress Bars**: Replaced traditional block characters with the sleek `▬` character across both `lmole` and `Mole`. Implemented a continuous, dual-tone style (Colored for usage, Gray for empty) for a premium dashboard look.
*   **CJK Character Alignment**: Solved the long-standing "jagged list" problem in terminals. Developed visual width detection (2 units for CJK, 1 for Latin) to ensure perfect vertical alignment of size columns regardless of filename language.
*   **Precise Formatting**: Optimized column spacing (5 spaces) and introduced human-centric units with proper spacing (e.g., `1.2 GB`) for maximum readability.

### 2. Intelligence & Insights
*   **Linux Hidden Space Insights**: Developed an automatic detection engine for Linux "disk killers." `lmole` now elevates Docker data, package manager caches (Apt/Pacman/Dnf), and system logs to the root view with an `👀` icon.
*   **Smart Downloads Analysis**: Added an "Old Downloads (90d+)" smart view that isolates forgotten files in `~/Downloads` for targeted cleanup.
*   **Age Hints**: Integrated modification-time analysis (e.g., `>90d`, `>6mo`, `>1y`) next to items to help users identify dormant data.
*   **Smart SQLite Vacuuming**: Implemented fragmentation checks for browser databases, only triggering the heavy `VACUUM` operation when reclaimable space exceeds 10%, drastically reducing maintenance time.

### 3. Core Enhancements
*   **Multi-Select Engine**: Introduced batch deletion support to the analysis module, enabling users to select multiple directories and purge them in one action.
*   **Interactive Top Files**: Transformed the "Largest Files" list into a fully interactive selector with multi-selection and safe trash integration.
*   **System Status Dashboard**: Overhauled the system health monitor with visual bars and aggregated memory usage by application name (summing Brave/Chrome sub-threads).

## Project: lmole (Linux Mole) - Professional Polish Phase

Today's session focused on visual refinement, interactive fluidity, and deep system integration, reaching 100% parity with the macOS Mole experience while maintaining Linux-specific performance advantages.

### 1. Application Management (Uninstall) - Pixel Perfecting
*   **Visual Replication**: Re-engineered the execution UI to perfectly match the user's provided screenshots, including the purple `☉` app prefix and green `✓` file removal icons.
*   **Interactive Flow**: 100% replicated the original Mole's "Review & Confirm" flow. Replaced blocking confirmation windows with a sleek, single-line purple prompt (`→ Remove X apps...`).
*   **Ghost App Prevention (Enhanced)**: Integrated `flatpak kill` alongside `pkill -9` to ensure Flatpak apps are fully terminated and file handles released before uninstallation, preventing "Directory not empty" errors.
*   **Total Footprint Accuracy**: Now calculates the sum of binaries, configurations, and cache folders in real-time, displaying the true reclaimed space for every application.

### 2. System Maintenance (Optimize) - Advanced Porting
*   **Professional Tasks**: Ported high-impact maintenance routines from macOS Mole to Linux:
    *   **SQLite Vacuum**: Automated history/cookie database compression for Firefox, Chrome, Brave, and Edge.
    *   **Zombie Autostart Cleanup**: Automatically detects and removes broken `.desktop` entries in `~/.config/autostart`.
    *   **Smart Swap Management**: Implemented logic to intelligently reset swap space when RAM is plentiful, reducing system micro-stutter.

### 3. Monitoring (Status) - Real-time Hardware Dashboard
*   **Dynamic Hardware Detection**: Refactored GPU monitoring to dynamically scan for graphics cards (card0, card1, etc.), resolving issues where AMD/Intel GPUs were not detected on multi-card systems.
*   **Process Insight**: Integrated a "Top Processes" list showing the top 3 memory-consuming apps directly on the dashboard.
*   **Minimalist UI**: Streamlined the dashboard layout by removing redundant separator lines and manufacturer branding (e.g., SKHynix) for a cleaner "information-only" look.

### 4. TUI Branding & Identity
*   **New Brand Logo**: Implemented the "Linux Power" ASCII art banner with a bold capitalized **L** and zero-gap character spacing for a cohesive, professional look.
*   **Identity Integration**: Embedded the GitHub repository link and the "Deep clean and optimize your Linux" tagline directly into the boot sequence.

### 5. Stability & Quality Assurance
*   **Test Synchronization**: Updated the 30-test suite to align with new logic (ID-based selection persistence and Flatpak name changes).
*   **Safety Guardrails**: Hardened the `is_protected` whitelist logic to prevent "recursive root protection" and enforced strict Home Directory Isolation for all manual removal tasks.
*   **Bug Fixes**: Resolved multiple `UnboundLocalError`, `NameError`, and path resolution bugs discovered during iterative stress testing.

    *   Fixed `NameError` and `UnboundLocalError` regressions in the UI logic.
*   **Documentation**: Created a professional, full-English `README.md` and a clean `.gitignore` for GitHub deployment.

### 5. Repository & Licensing
*   **GitHub Ready**: Initialized Git repository, handled license considerations (MIT), and prepared the project for public release.
*   **Naming**: Drafted a professional inquiry letter to the original macOS Mole author for naming permission.
