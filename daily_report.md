## Project: topo (Topo) - Hardware Insights & Navigation Polish

Today's session focused on expanding Topo's diagnostic capabilities and achieving a professional, silent exit experience for high-efficiency users.

### 1. Hardware & Network Diagnostics
*   **Real-time Fan Monitoring**: Implemented `get_fan_speed()` to probe `/sys/class/hwmon`. Topo now displays active fan RPMs in the Status dashboard with "Intelligent Silence" (hiding the line on fanless systems).
*   **Network IP Insights**: Integrated public and local IP detection. The dashboard now displays the user's geographic location via a 2-letter country code (e.g., `[CN]`) alongside their public IP address, using a lightweight API with aggressive timeouts for responsiveness.
*   **Architecture Parity Verification**: Successfully conducted ARM64 cross-architecture testing using Podman and QEMU, confirming that all TUI and installation logic is 100% compatible with aarch64 environments.

### 2. Interaction & TUI Refinement
*   **Unified Return/Exit Prompts**: Standardized all post-task prompts to "**Press Enter to return, ESC to exit...**" using a new `Navigator.wait_for_return()` helper. This ensures consistent, non-blocking single-key interaction across the entire application (Clean, Uninstall, Purge, Status).
*   **Terminal History Preservation**: Implemented the **Alternate Screen Buffer** (`\033[?1049h`) for all interactive modes. Topo now runs in a temporary terminal layer, ensuring that your previous shell history and output are perfectly restored upon exit.
*   **Professional Silent Exit**: Removed all conversational "Goodbye!" messages. Topo now exits cleanly and silently to the shell prompt.
*   **Intelligent Header Silence**: Implemented stdout redirection in the Clean runner. Category headers are now only printed if their sub-tasks actually reclaim space.

### 3. Intelligent Cleanup Engine (Architecture 2.0)
*   **Proactive App Detection**: Implemented a self-learning engine that automatically identifies newly installed software and registers their cache/config paths for high-precision cleaning.
*   **Registry Self-Maintenance**: Introduced `detected_apps.json` with automatic "health checks" that prune entries for uninstalled apps once their remnants are cleared.
*   **AI Developer Lifecycle**: Optimized `Hugging Face` and `Ollama` cleanup with age-aware logic (keeping "hot" models from the last 14 days). Added smart purging for `PyTorch`, `Triton`, and `CUDA` kernel caches.
*   **Cross-Distro Enhancements**:
    *   **Ubuntu**: Added specialized cleanup for `Snap` revisions and `Multipass` instances.
    *   **Fedora/Generic**: Implemented full `Podman` system pruning and transfer cache removal.
    *   **AppImage Support**: Developed a "Desktop Link Trace" method to identify and purge remnants of deleted AppImage files.
*   **WeChat Ecosystem Support**: Added comprehensive multi-path, multi-process protection and cleanup for various Linux WeChat versions (Flatpak, Wine, UOS).
*   **Self-Preservation Logic**: Implemented path-based protection to prevent Topo from recursively deleting its own configuration and registry files.

### 4. Architecture & Maintenance
*   **Installation UX Polish**: Updated `install.sh` to suggest `topo --help` upon successful installation, encouraging users to explore the full range of system optimization commands.
*   **Ruff Code Quality Integration**: Integrated the **Ruff** engine for ultra-fast linting and formatting. Resolved 100+ issues, including:
    *   Eliminated all **bare `except` blocks** for better error handling.
    *   Fixed **undefined name** and scope shadowing bugs in the Analysis and Uninstall modules.
    *   Simplified complex conditional logic and standardized imports across the project.
*   **Logic Decoupling**: Centralized all cleaning constants and refactored core file operations (process checks, registry) to `src/core/file_ops.py` to eliminate circular dependencies.
*   **Three-Layer Filtering**: Established a robust cleaning hierarchy: High-Precision (Predefined) → Heuristic (Pattern-based) → Orphan Detection (Binary-cross-referencing).
*   **Documentation Alignment**: Updated `README.md` with the new `assets/topo_home.png` screenshot and refreshed all terminal mocks. Optimized ASCII banner alignment in `src/ui/tui.py`.

## Project: topo (Topo) - Visual Identity & UX Perfection

Today's session focused on solidifying Topo's brand identity, achieving 100% parity with the "Mole" aesthetic, and resolving deep-level TUI interaction bugs.

### 1. Visual Identity & Branding
*   **Earth Theme Transition**: Officially adopted **Yellow4 / Earth (#8B8B00)** as the primary brand color. Updated the TUI banner and `src/core/constants.py` to reflect this "deep digging" aesthetic.
*   **Professional Logo Integration**: Added a high-quality badger logo (`assets/topo.png`) to the repository and redesigned the `README.md` header to be centered and visually stunning, matching the original Mole project.
*   **README Overhaul**: Completely rewritten the documentation to include centered badges, realistic terminal output mocks, and detailed technical advantage highlights.

### 2. Interaction & UX Refinement
*   **The "ESC" Breakthrough**: Resolved a critical low-level bug where an isolated ESC key would hang the TUI. Re-engineered `Navigator.get_key()` to use non-blocking `os.read` and `select` logic.
*   **Safety-First Exit Policy**: Removed the 'Q' key as a quit shortcut across all menus to prevent accidental character entry during system `sudo` prompts.
*   **Fast Navigation**: Implemented **Horizontal Arrow Key (←→)** support for rapid page switching in the application uninstaller.
*   **UI Compaction**: Consolidated multi-line footer hints into a single, high-density professional status line. Increased uninstaller list density to 15 items per page.
*   **Focused Highlighting**: Added **Bold Magenta** highlighting for the focused item in the Analyze Disk view, significantly improving navigation tracking.

### 3. Engine & Logic Hardening
*   **Intelligent Silence (Headers)**: Implemented a stdout buffering mechanism in the Clean runner. Category headers (e.g., "➤ System") are now intelligently hidden if no tasks within that category reclaim space, ensuring a zero-noise execution log.
*   **Accurate Reporting**: Fixed a critical result aggregation bug. All sub-task bytes (especially Cargo and DNF caches) are now perfectly accumulated, resulting in a 100% accurate "Total space freed" summary with a per-category breakdown.
*   **Cache Synchronization**: Implemented `ScanCache.clear()`. Performing a Clean, Purge, or Uninstall now automatically invalidates the Analyze Disk cache, ensuring that deleted items disappear instantly from the explorer.
*   **Strict Authentication**: Hardened `ensure_sudo_session` to force an explicit password prompt for every cleanup session (via `sudo -k`), while maintaining a bypass for users with permanent `NOPASSWD` rules.
*   **Ubuntu 24.04 Verification**: Conducted rigorous compatibility tests using Podman containers. Topo is now confirmed to be 100% functional on the latest Ubuntu LTS releases.
*   **Full Internationalization**: Translated every remaining Chinese comment and section header (including `.gitignore` and the `topo` launcher) into professional English.

## Project: topo (Topo) - Professional Distribution & Modular Refactoring

Today's session transformed Topo into a production-ready tool with a streamlined codebase, professional release workflow, and enhanced lifecycle management.

### 1. Architectural Refactoring (The "Slim main" Initiative)
*   **Decoupled CLI Entry**: Drastically reduced `src/main.py` from 410 lines to under 160 lines. Extracted heavy business logic into dedicated runners.
*   **Consolidated Cleaning Modules**: 
    -   Relocated App Uninstallation logic to `src/clean/app_manager.py`.
    -   Merged Project Purge logic into `src/clean/project.py`.
    -   Renamed Self-Uninstall to `src/manage/remove.py` for clarity.
*   **Legacy Cleanup**: Permanently removed the obsolete `topo.py` root script and purged all historical `lmole` references.

### 2. Lifecycle & Distribution
*   **One-Line Installer (`install.sh`)**: Implemented a sophisticated `curl | bash` installer that handles prerequisites, performs shallow clones, and executes "Smart Refinement" to delete non-runtime files (tests, reports, Rust sources).
*   **Automated Release Workflow**: Configured GitHub Actions to cross-compile x86_64 and ARM64 binaries on every version tag. Topo now pulls optimized engines from GitHub Release Assets rather than storing them in the Git history.
*   **Smart Update Command**: Introduced `topo update`, enabling users to refresh their entire installation (including binaries) with a single command.
*   **Installation Automation**: Added `topo link` to safely manage symbolic links in `~/.local/bin`.

### 3. Engine & Performance
*   **Multi-Arch Native Support**: Established full parity for **ARM64** (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi) and **x86_64**. The system dynamically detects CPU architecture and provisions the correct Rust engine.
*   **Intelligent Silence Policy**: Re-engineered all cleanup functions to adopt a "zero-gain silence" rule. If no space is freed, the task remains invisible to keep terminal output clean.
*   **Sudo Pre-authorization**: Moved administrative checks to the task start, ensuring the "One-Key Clean" process is never interrupted by password prompts once execution begins.

### 4. Visual Identity & Documentation
*   **New Identity**: Formally adopted the **Badger (`🦡`)** as Topo's mascot and updated the Cyber-Block TUI banner with capitalized branding.
*   **Documentation Overhaul**: Rewrote `README.md` to focus on the new automated installation method and highlighted advanced technical advantages like Multi-Arch and Zero-Interruption UI.

## Project: topo (Topo) - Extreme UX & Interaction Refinement

Today's session focused on advanced TUI interaction, responsive design, and perfecting the navigation flow for heavy users.

### 1. Interaction & Workflow
*   **Integrated Numeric Checkboxes**: Re-engineered the "Analyze Disk" selection UI to merge indices into the selection brackets (e.g., `[1]`, `[12]`). Numbers are dynamically replaced with a green `[✓]` upon selection, mirroring the elite `Uninstall` module.
*   **Multi-Digit Selection**: Implemented an intelligent digit buffering system. Users can now select any item (1-50) by quickly typing its index (e.g., press `1` then `4` to select item 14). The logic was further hardened with **Raw-Mode Buffering**, ensuring lightning-fast, non-blocking capture of numeric sequences across all terminals.
*   **Zero-Latency Navigation**: Optimized the directory traversal engine with a **State Snapshot Stack**. Returning to parent directories is now instantaneous and completely bypasses the Rust engine scan, as previous results are cached in memory.
*   **Selection Summary**: Added a persistent **"☉ Selected Items to Remove"** summary at the bottom of the analysis views (Main and Top Files), providing clear visibility of the removal queue in the signature Mole purple style.
*   **Auto-Back Logic**: Enhanced the cleaning workflow to automatically return to the parent directory when the current folder becomes empty after deletion, reducing manual keypresses.

### 3. Layout & Accessibility
*   **Official Rebranding**: Successfully transitioned the project name from `lmole` to **Topo** (derived from the Spanish word for Mole). This move defines Topo as a high-performance, independent Linux system optimizer.
*   **New Visual Identity**: Implemented a minimalist 'Console Ninja' ASCII banner with a non-slanted font, following the user's preference for a clean, professional terminal aesthetic.
*   **Global Code Refresh**: Performed a project-wide refactoring to update all module names, binary targets (`topo-core`), and documentation to reflect the new brand.
*   **CLI Interface Modernization**: Re-engineered the `topo --help` output with a professional, categorized sub-command structure.

 The UI dynamically detects terminal width, automatically shrinking or hiding progress bars and truncating filenames to prevent line wrapping on small screens.
*   **Navigation Stability**: Performed a deep-level stabilization of the arrow key capture logic. Refined the raw-mode input buffer to ensure 100% reliable 3-byte escape sequence capture across GNOME Terminal, xterm, and SSH sessions.
*   **Back Navigation Overhaul**: Added support for **B** and **H** (Vim-style) keys for returning to previous folders, alongside a clearer `← Back` UI hint.
*   **Search Revert**: Decoupled the experimental real-time search from the `Uninstall` module to restore rock-solid stability to the core navigation system while keeping the visual and alignment improvements.
